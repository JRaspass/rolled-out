<h1>About</h1>

<p>
    Rolled Out Info is a free,
    <a href="//github.com/JRaspass/rolled-out">open source</a>
    website built by community developers upon the
    <a href="//scores.rolledoutgame.com">data</a>
    made available by Polarbyte Games for the
    <a href="//rolledoutgame.com">Rolled Out!</a> game.

<h2>Points</h2>

<p>
    Each stage offers a maximum of 1,000 points, broken up into three
    available pools, 750, 200, and 50.

<h3>750 points</h3>

<p>
    Based on your time relative to the first and last place times within the
    Top 100.

<p>
    So if first place finished with 50 seconds and 100th place finished with
    30 seconds, a 40 second time would net you 375 points.

<h3>200 points</h3>

<p>
    Based on your ranking. Players in the Top 10 will net the following extra
    points:

<p>
    1st - 200, 2nd - 150, 3rd - 100, 4th - 75, 5th - 60, 6th - 50, 7th - 40,
    8th - 30, 9th -20, 10th - 10.

<h3>50 points</h3>

<p>
    Everyone who makes the Top 100 leaderboard gets 50 points. This is so that
    last place within the Top 100 still gets some deserved points.

<p>
    For example, here's how the scoring plays out for the first level,
    <a href=/tranquility/abstraction>Abstraction</a>:

<table class=overflow-second>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class=center>#
            <th class=wide>Player
            <th class=center>Time
            <th class=center>Points
    <tbody>
    {{ $skip := false }}
    {{ range .Data }}
        {{ if and $skip (ne .Rank 100) }}
            {{ continue }}
        {{ end }}
        <tr>
            <td class="center rank-{{ .Rank }}">{{ .Rank }}
            <td class=wide><a href="/players/{{ path .Player }}">{{ .Player }}</a>
            <td class=right>{{ time_sec .TimeRemaining }}
            <td>{{ .PointsTime }} + {{ .PointsRank }} + 50 = {{ comma .Points }}

        {{ if and (lt 10 .Rank) (lt .Rank 100) }}
            {{ $skip = true }}
            <tr><td class=center colspan=4>â€¦
        {{ end }}
    {{ end }}
</table>

<p>
    A note for stages with multiple goals - only your fastest time for a stage
    will count towards your Points, Average Rank, and Total Time.
